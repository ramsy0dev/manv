"""Deterministic rendering helpers for backend selection reports.

Why this module exists:
- The resolver returns structured data, but several frontends need a stable
  textual representation: CLI, tests, and eventually packaged runtime logs.
- Keeping rendering separate from selection logic prevents the resolver from
  accreting UI concerns.
