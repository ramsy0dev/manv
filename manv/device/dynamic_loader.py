"""Small cross-platform shared-library probing helpers.

Why this module exists:
- Probe-only backends still need to answer "is the vendor runtime present?"
  without importing a heavy Python binding or crashing module import.
- The resolver needs deterministic skip reasons, not ad-hoc `OSError` strings.

Design notes:
- This helper intentionally does not perform deep runtime initialization.
  Loading and symbol lookup are enough for the early selection/reporting phases.
- Candidate ordering is stable so the resulting skip reason remains stable.
