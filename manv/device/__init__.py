"""Device backend selection surface for ManV.

Why this package exists:
- The compiler/runtime previously mixed backend naming, probing, dispatch, and
  textual backend emission inside one compatibility module.
- The single-executable roadmap needs a small, explicit subsystem that can be
  reused by the CLI, packaged runtime, debugger, and tests.

Important invariants:
- Host execution remains the semantic authority for whole-program behavior.
- Device probing and selection must be deterministic so `--report backend`
  output is snapshot-friendly and easy to reason about.
- Backend-name normalization lives here so the rest of the codebase stops
  carrying divergent alias tables.
