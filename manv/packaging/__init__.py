"""Custom single-file packaging support for ManV builds.

Why this package exists:
- `manv build` is moving away from a copied source tree toward a one-file
  runnable bundle.
- The packaging layer needs explicit metadata and bundle-writing helpers so the
  build pipeline stays deterministic and inspectable.
