"""Host backend selection and reporting.

Why this package exists:
- ManV now distinguishes the CPU-side host backend from optional GPU device
  backends. The host backend decides how normal program code runs; the device
  backend only accelerates `@gpu` regions.
- `manv build` and `manv compile` need a stable place to resolve "auto" host
  behavior without coupling CLI code to LLVM/interpreter implementation
  details.

Important invariants:
- Host-backend selection is deterministic. There is no probing priority list:
  `auto` always resolves to `llvm`.
- The interpreter backend remains available for debugging and parity checks,
  but it is never the resolved default once host backend selection is active.
