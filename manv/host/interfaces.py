"""Interfaces and report types for ManV host backend selection.

Why this module exists:
- The device resolver already has structured reporting. The host side needs the
  same discipline so compile/build decisions can be tested and documented.
- Keeping host selection separate from LLVM codegen keeps the policy layer
  small and auditable.

Important invariants:
- The host report records what the user asked for and what ManV resolved to.
- Reporting omits timestamps and other non-deterministic data so tests can
  snapshot the exact backend decision output.
