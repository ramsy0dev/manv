"""CUDA-side memory bookkeeping.

Why this exists:
- The runtime needs a stable home for residency tracking and device buffer
  ownership that is separate from the backend selection layer.
- The first version keeps the model intentionally conservative: buffers are
  synchronized at the GPU boundary and residency tracking is advisory.
